## Problem 1

### Tidying Data

Create a city\_state variable (e.g. “Baltimore, MD”), and a binary
variable indicating whether the homicide is solved. Omit cities Dallas,
TX; Phoenix, AZ; and Kansas City, MO – these don’t report victim race.
Also omit Tulsa, AL – this is a data entry mistake. Modifiy victim\_race
to have categories white and non-white, with white as the reference
category. Be sure that victim\_age is numeric.

``` r
homicide_data = read_csv(file = "./homicide-data.csv")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_integer(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

``` r
#create city_state variable and omit certain cities
homicide_data =
  homicide_data %>% 
  mutate(city_state = str_c(city, ", ", state)) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Dallas, TX", city_state != "Phoenix, AZ", city_state != "Kansas City, MO", city_state != "Tulsa, AL") 

#create binary variable
homicide_data = 
  homicide_data %>% 
  mutate(hom_solved = as.numeric(disposition == "Closed by arrest"))

#modify victim_race to binary category
homicide_data = 
  homicide_data %>% 
  mutate(victim_race = recode(victim_race, 'White' = "White", 'Hispanic' = "Non_white", 'Other' = "Non_white", 'Black' = "Non_white", 'Asian' = "Non_white", 'Unknown' = "Non_white")) %>% 
  mutate(victim_race = fct_relevel(victim_race, "White"))

#change victim_age to numeric
homicide_data = 
  homicide_data %>% 
  mutate(victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age))
```

### GLM on Baltimore, MD

For the city of Baltimore, MD, use the glm function to fit a logistic
regression with resolved vs unresolved as the outcome and victim age,
sex and race (as just defined) as predictors. Save the output of glm as
an R object; apply the broom::tidy to this object; and obtain the
estimate and confidence interval of the adjusted odds ratio for solving
homicides comparing black victims to white victims keeping all other
variables fixed.

``` r
Baltimore_df = 
  homicide_data %>% 
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD") %>% 
  select(hom_solved, victim_age, victim_race, victim_sex)

Baltimore_glm = 
  Baltimore_df %>% 
  glm(hom_solved ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, data = ., family = binomial()) %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  mutate(OR = exp(estimate)) %>%
  select(term, log_OR = estimate, OR, p.value) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)

Baltimore_glm  
```

| term                   | log\_OR |    OR | p.value |
| :--------------------- | ------: | ----: | ------: |
| (Intercept)            |   1.186 | 3.274 |   0.000 |
| victim\_age            | \-0.007 | 0.993 |   0.032 |
| victim\_raceNon\_white | \-0.820 | 0.441 |   0.000 |
| victim\_sexMale        | \-0.888 | 0.412 |   0.000 |

``` r
#how to get conf intervals
#confint(Baltimore_glm)
```

### GLM on all cities

Now run glm for each of the cities in your dataset, and extract the
adjusted odds ratio (and CI) for solving homicides comparing black
victims to white victims. Do this within a “tidy” pipeline, making use
of purrr::map, list columns, and unnest as necessary to create a
dataframe with estimated ORs and CIs for each city.

``` r
all_cities_df = 
  homicide_data %>% 
  select(city_state, hom_solved, victim_age, victim_race, victim_sex)

all_cities_glm = 
  all_cities_df %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  nest() %>% 
  mutate(model = map(data, ~glm(hom_solved ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, data = ., family = binomial())),
  model = map(model, broom::tidy)) %>% 
  select(-data) %>% 
  unnest() %>% 
  mutate(OR = exp(estimate)) %>%
  select(city_state, term, log_OR = estimate, OR, p.value) 
```

### Plot estimates and CIs on all cities

Create a plot that shows the estimated ORs and CIs for each city.
Organize cities according to estimated OR, and comment on the plot.

``` r
Plot_all_cities =
  all_cities_glm %>% 
  ggplot(aes(fct_reorder(city_state, log_OR), log_OR)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) +
  labs(
    title = "Estimates and CIs for All Cities",
    x = "City",
    y = "Estimates"
  )  +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) 

Plot_all_cities
```
